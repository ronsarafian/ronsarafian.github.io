Supervised by [Dr Jonathan Rosenblatt](http://www.john-ros.com/) and [Prof Itai Kloog](http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/humsos/geog/Pages/staff/kloog.aspx). 

My research focuses on statistical and machine learning algorithms and their application in geographical and environmental fields.

I am interested in solving both theoretical and real-world problems related to:

- Spatio-temporal data analysis
- Remote sensing based prediction 
- Multivariate statistics
- Distributed Machine Learning
