My research focuses on statistical and machine learning algorithms and their application in geographical and environmental fields.

I am interested in solving both theoretical and real-world problems related to:

- Spatio-temporal data analysis
- Remote sensing based prediction 
- Multivariate statistics
- Distributed Machine Learning
